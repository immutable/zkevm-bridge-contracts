/**
 * @title  Root ERC 20 Bridge Flow Rate
 * @author Immutable Pty Ltd (Peter Robinson @drinkcoffee, Craig MacGregor @proletesseract)
 * @notice Adds security features to the `RootERC20Bridge` implementation help prevent or reduce the scope of attacks.
 * @dev    Features: In addition the features of the `RootERC20Bridge`, this contract adds the following capabilities:
 *         - A withdrawal queue is defined. In certain situations, a crosschain transfer results
 *           in a withdrawal being put in a "queue". Users can withdraw the amount after a delay.
 *           The default delay is one day. The queue is implemented as an array. Users can choose
 *           which queued withdrawals they want to process.
 *         - An account with `RATE` role can enable or disable the withdrawal queue, and configure
 *           parameters for each token related to the withdrawal queue.
 *         - Withdrawals of tokens whose amount is greater than a token specific threshold are
 *           put into the withdrawal queue. This just affects an individual withdrawal. It does
 *           not affect other withdrawals by that user or by any other user.
 *         - Withdrawals are put into the withdrawal queue when no thresholds have been defined
 *           for the token being withdrawn. This just affects an individual withdrawal. It does
 *           not affect other withdrawals by that user or by any other user.
 *         - If the rate of withdrawal of any token is over a token specific threshold, then all
 *           withdrwals are put into the withdrawal queue.
 *
 *         Almost all users will be unaffected by these changes, and for them the bridge will
 *         appear to operate as if `RootERC20Bridge` contract had been deployed. That is,
 *         almost all withdrawals will not go into a withdrawal queue if the
 *         RootERC20BridgeFlowRate contract has been configured for all tokens
 *         that are likely to be used on the bridge with appropriate thresholds.
 *
 *         Note: This is an upgradeable contract that should be operated behind OpenZeppelin's
 *               TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol.
 *         Note: The initialize function is susceptible to front running. To prevent this,
 *               call the function when TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol is deployed by passing
 *               in the function call data in TransparentUpgradeableProxy's constructor.
 *               Alternatively, deploy TransparentUpgradeableProxy, call initialize, and then
 *               check the contract's configuration. If the initialize call has been front run,
 *               deploy a new instance of TransparentUpgradeableProxy and repeat the process.
 *         Note: Administrators should take care when configuring flow rate values for tokens.
 *               The configuration should be reviewed from time to time. For example, an
 *               attacker could cheaply trigger the withdrawal queue if one token has a flow rate
 *               configuration (capacity and refill rate) that has a substantially lower value
 *               than other tokens. The attacker could trigger the withdrawal queue, hope that
 *               administrators will reduce the withdrawal delay, to expedite the clearance of
 *               legitimate transactions in the withdrawal queue, and then execute their main
 *               attack, withdrawing a large sum via some other unrelated bridge attack. The
 *               way to protect against this is to have flow rate configurations for all
 *               configured tokens to be for similar amounts and be wary of reducing the withdrawal
 *               delay.
 *               Another consideration is that an attacker could observe pending withdrawals,
 *               and grief a legitimate user's withdrawal. They could do this by withdrawing a
 *               sum, which when combined with the users, is just about the flow rate that will
 *               trigger the withdrawal queue, immediately before the legitimate user. The
 *               legitimate user's withdrawal would then trigger the withdrawal queue. The
 *               mitigation for this is to make the flow rate configurations such that an
 *               attacker would need to invest substantial amounts to attack the system in
 *               this way. This requires monitoring what typical bridge flows are, and
 *               understanding how they change with time.

     * @param largeTransferThreshold Threshold over which a withdrawal is deemed to be large,
     *         and will be put in the withdrawal queue.
     * @dev Only RATE role.
     *
     * Example parameter values:
     *  Assume the desired configuration is:
     *  - large transfer threshold is 100,000 IMX.
     *  - high flow rate threshold is 1,000,000 IMX per hour.
     *  Further assume the ERC 20 contract has been configured with 18 decimals. This is true
     *  for IMX and MATIC.
     *
     *  The capacity should be set to the flow rate number. In this example, 1,000,000 IMX.
     *  The refill rate should be the capacity divided by the flow rate period in seconds.
     *   In this example, 1,000,000 IMX divided by 3600 seconds in an hour.
     *
     *  Hence, the configuration should be set to:
     *  - capacity = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
     *  - refillRate =     277,777,777,777,777,777,777
     *  - largeTransferThreshold = 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
     *
     * NOTE: Beyond checking that capacity and refillRate are not zero, no range checking is
     *       undertaken on capacity, refillRate, or largeTransferThreshold. Setting
     *       largeTransferThreshold to zero (or a very low value) would cause all (or most)
     *       withdrawals to be put the with withdrawal queue. Having a very large value for
     *       largeTransferThreshold or capacity will either reduce the effectiveness of
     *       the flow rate detection mechanism or prevent it from working altogether. As such,
     *       the values of capacity, refillRate and largeTransferThreshold should be chosen
     *       carefully.
